/**
* Problem
* 1).You are given a matrix M of size n x n where:
* 2).M[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j
* 3).M[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j
* 4).A celebrity is defined as someone who:
* 5).Doesn't know anyone else (M[celebrity][j] == 0 for all j != celebrity)
* 6).Is known by everyone else (M[i][celebrity] == 1 for all i != celebrity)
* 7).Your task is to find the index of the celebrity if one exists, else return -1.
* 8).Optimal Algorithm (Using Stack) - O(n)
* 9).Push all n people to a stack.
* 10).Pop two people at a time and compare:
* 11).If A knows B, then A cannot be the celebrity. Push B back.
* 12).If A does not know B, then B cannot be the celebrity. Push A back.
* 13).Eventually, one person remains â€” check if that person is a celebrity.
